## Anatomy

The `OrderbookTable` is a compound component designed for flexibility. While the `Root` component provides a batteries-included default experience, you can compose the sub-components manually for custom layouts.

### Root
The entry point that manages status synchronization, responsive breakpoints, and automatic "Limit" configuration based on container size.

### Chart
A specialized container for a list of price levels. It wraps rows and applies necessary data processing for visual depth.

### Row
Renders the headers and the individual price level items, including the SVG/CSS-based background depth bars.

### Skeleton
Provides a shimmering loading state mapped to the current responsive limit (`n`).

## Features

### Responsive Auto-Limit
The table uses a `useBreakpoint` hook to detect container size and automatically updates the Orderbook's `limit` via `useOrderbookConfig`. This ensures the table always fills the available vertical space without scrolling containers unnecessarily.

| Breakpoint | Rows (n) |
| :--- | :--- |
| default | 15 |
| md | 11 |
| lg/xl | 22 |
| 2xl | 36 |
| 3xl | 44 |

### Bid/Ask Mirroring
The component detects the `type` prop (`bids` | `asks`). For **bids**, it renders labels and values in a Right-to-Left (RTL) logical order (Total, Quantity, Price) with green depth bars. For **asks**, it reverses the order to create a mirrored "book" look with red depth bars.

### Integrated Playback
The `Root` component automatically connects to `useOrderbookPlayback()`, meaning the table instantly supports time-traveling, pausing, and live-syncing when combined with playback controls.
