The `@krono/kit` SDK is a React component library built around the `@krono/hooks` and `@krono/core` SDK.
It provides components for displaying orderbook data, time travel controls and many more.
You can find the `@krono/kit` SDK source code on Github.

You can get an interactive demo of the components by visiting the Storybook.

To get started, install the required packages.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash bun
    bun add @krono/kit
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add @krono/kit
    ```

    ```bash npm
    npm install @krono/kit
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add @krono/kit
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
    The Krono packages are not yet published to the npm registry.
    To use them, you’ll need to install and link the packages locally by following the
    <a href="../development/getting-started">development guide</a>.
</Warning>

## Create Config

Create and export a new Krono config.

```typescript create-config.ts
import { OrderbookConfig } from '@krono/hooks'

export const config = new OrderbookConfig({
    symbol: "BTC/USD",
})
```
In this example, Krono is configured to use the BTC/USD pair. Check out the config docs for more configuration options.


## Wrap Component in Context Provider

Wrap your component in the `OrderbookProvider` React Context Provider and pass the config you created earlier to the config property.

```tsx App.tsx
import { OrderbookProvider  } from '@krono/hooks'
import { config } from './config'

function App() {
  return (
    <OrderbookProvider config={config}>
      {/** ... */}
    </OrderbookProvider>
  )
}
```

## Use Krono

Now that everything is set up, every component inside `OrderbookProvider` can use Krono Kit.
