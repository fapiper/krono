description: 'Set up your local development environment and install Krono packages'
---

Krono utilizes a modern toolchain powered by [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/).
Whether you are contributing to the core library or integrating the kit into your own project, these steps will get you up and running in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Recommended)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally for development.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the Repository">
        Clone the Krono repository to your local machine:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/fapiper/krono.git
        cd krono
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Install Dependencies">
        Install all dependencies across the monorepo using your preferred package manager.

        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash bun
            bun install
            ```
            ```bash npm
            npm install
            ```
            ```bash pnpm
            pnpm install
            ```
            ```bash yarn
            yarn install
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start Development Server">
        Run the development server to watch for changes and start all applications:
        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash bun
            bun dev
            ```
            ```bash npm
            npm run dev
            ```
            ```bash pnpm
            pnpm dev
            ```
            ```bash yarn
            yarn dev
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        This command initializes:
        * **Web app:** `http://localhost:4000`
        * **React example:** `http://localhost:5173`
        * **Documentation:** `http://localhost:3000`
        * **Storybook:** `http://localhost:6006`
    </Step>
</Steps>
