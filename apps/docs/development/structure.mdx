---

Krono organizes its applications and shared logic into distinct packages to promote code reuse and separation of concerns.

## Directory Layout

We use a standard Turborepo structure where shared libraries live in `packages/` and deployable applications live in `apps/`.

```txt
krono/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # The main Next.js demo application
│   ├── docs/         # This documentation site (Mintlify)
│   └── storybook/    # Component development environment
├── packages/
│   ├── core/         # Vanilla TS business logic (WebSocket, Orderbook)
│   ├── hooks/        # React hooks wrapping the core logic
│   ├── kit/          # UI components (shadcn/ui + Tailwind)
│   ├── ui/           # Shared internal UI utilities
│   └── tsconfig/     # Shared TypeScript configurations
├── examples/         # Implementation examples for users
└── package.json      # Root configuration
```

## Technology Stack

Krono is built on a modern, type-safe stack designed for performance and developer experience.
