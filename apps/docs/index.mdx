## Overview

Krono provides a complete solution for visualizing cryptocurrency orderbook data from Kraken's WebSocket API.
It is built with three layers that work independently or together:

- **Core**: Framework-agnostic orderbook logic with WebSocket management
- **Hooks**: React integration library
- **Kit**: Pre-built UI components using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS

## Features

<Check>Real-time orderbook updates via WebSocket</Check>
<Check>Accurate time travel through historical states</Check>
<Check>Optimized performance with throttling and debouncing</Check>
<Check>Customizable depth levels (10, 25, 100, 500, 1000)</Check>
<Check>Automatic live tracking with manual playback controls</Check>
<Check>Framework-agnostic core (React, Vue, Svelte support possible)</Check>

## Architecture

The three-layer architecture ensures you can use only what you need:

<Columns cols={2}>
    <Card
        title="Core"
        icon="toy-brick"
        href="/essentials/markdown"
    >
        Use Core alone for custom implementations in any framework.
    </Card>
    <Card
        title="Hooks"
        icon="code"
        href="/essentials/code"
    >
        Add Hooks for React state management and event handling.
    </Card>
    <Card
        title="Kit"
        icon="image"
        href="/essentials/images"
    >
        Include Kit for ready-to-use components with built-in styling.
    </Card>
</Columns>

## Quick Example
```tsx
import { OrderbookVisualizer } from '@krono/kit';

export default function App() {
  return (

  );
}
```

That's it. You now have a live orderbook with time travel capabilities.
