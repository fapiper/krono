title: 'Fetch'
description: 'Triggers a request to the Kraken REST API to retrieve and process asset pairs.'
---

## Import

```ts
import { AssetPairs } from '@krono/core'
```

## Usage

Call this method to manually trigger the fetching sequence. This is automatically called in the constructor if `autoFetch` is set to `true`.

```ts
const assetPairs = new AssetPairs({ autoFetch: false })

// Manually fetch data
await assetPairs.fetch()
```

## Return Type

```ts
Promise<AssetPairsData>
```

Returns a promise that resolves with the processed asset data (list of symbols and the lookup map) once the HTTP request completes successfully.
