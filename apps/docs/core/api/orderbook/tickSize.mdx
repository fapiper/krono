## Import

## Usage

This property is used as the base unit for all price calculations and aggregation.
When you update `tickSize`, the `groupingOptions` are automatically recalculated to remain proportional to the asset's price precision.

```ts
const orderbook = new Orderbook({ symbol: 'BTC/USD' })

orderbook.tickSize = 0.01
```

```ts
