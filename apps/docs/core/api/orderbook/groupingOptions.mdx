title: 'GroupingOptions'
description: 'Property containing a list of 9 price aggregation intervals. These intervals are calculated by applying a geometric multiplier sequence to the current `tickSize`.'
---

## Import

```ts
import { Orderbook } from '@krono/core'
```

## Usage

The options are generated using a fixed multiplier set: [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500]. This ensures that regardless of whether an asset is worth $\$0.001$ or $\$100,000$, the user always has logical, human-readable grouping steps.

```ts
// groupingOptions will be: [0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250]
const options = orderbook.groupingOptions

// Use these options to populate a UI dropdown
options.forEach(val => console.log(`Group by: ${val}`))
```

## Type

```ts
number[]
```
