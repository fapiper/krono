description: 'Krono is built with TypeScript from the ground up, providing comprehensive type safety across all packages. Every API, hook, and component is fully typed to give you the best developer experience.'

<Info>
    All packages export complete type definitions out of the box
</Info>

## Requirements

Krono is designed to be as type-safe as possible!
Every function, hook, and component has complete type definitions.
Things to keep in mind:

- Krono requires TypeScript 5.0 or higher
- TypeScript doesn't follow semver and often introduces breaking changes in minor releases
- To ensure everything works correctly, make sure your `tsconfig.json` has strict mode set to true.
- Best Practice: Lock your `typescript` package to a specific patch version.
